\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Structs sit at the core of every SwiftUI app, so it\'92s really important you take some extra time to make sure you understand what they do and how they work.\
To check your knowledge, here\'92s a small task for you: create a struct to store information about a car, including its model, number of seats, and current gear, then add a method to change gears up or down. Have a think about variables and access control: what data should be a variable rather than a constant, and what data should be exposed publicly? Should the gear-changing method validate its input somehow?}
